# JS Tidbits

### JS Tidbits is a collection of solutions of different programming problems as well as concepts in JavaScript.  

#### As part of Hacktoberfest I am inviting people to contribute to it.

#### How to Contribute

There are 3 different ways you can contibute:

  1. Know a Programming problem you want to solve in JavaScrpit, Go to **problems** folder inside **src** and add your solution file with a `.js` extension.
  2. You want to Provide example of any JavaScript concept, Go to **concepts** folder inside **src** and add your file with proper examlpe.
  3. See a bug, a code not working, or you think you can write a better code, fix it and raise a PR.
  
 NOTE: 
  - Please do not copy paste code from the internet and add in here!
  - Your code must be working


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Creating a PR for any issue
Please Check if Someone has already been assigned the task or not. After creating PR ask for assigning the task to yourself.

#### Concepts

| Async Await           | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/asyncAwait.js)          | ```async``` is used to specify that a function will return a 'promise', ```await``` makes JS wait til the promises is resolve (like a promise in real life it could be true or false) |
| Compose               | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/compose.js)             | ```compose``` takes a series of single parameters functions that are used as the parameters of the previous function. |
| Console               | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/console.js)             | ```console``` is used in the debugging process, it will display a message in the web console, it has methods as ```log()```, ```error()```, ```warn()```, etc |
| Currying              | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/currying.js)            | Currying allows to translate a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c). |
| ES7                   | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/ES7.js)                 | ES7üåü features: array.prototype.includes and exponentiation operator |
| ES8                   | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/ES7.js)                 | ES8 features: object.values, object/entries, string padding |
| ES10                  | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/ES10.js)                | ES10: Array.flat(), Array.flatMap(), String.trim(), trimEnd() and trimStart(), Object.fromEntries and Optional Catch Binding |
| Lexical Scope         | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/lexicalScope.js)        | Lexical scoping refers to how variables in nested functions/inner levels can access to its outer levels (function scope, global scope) |
| Prototype Inheritance | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/prototypalInheritance.js)| A prototype object is a template object, from which other objects can inherit methods and properties. |
| Try - Catch           | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/concepts/tryCatch.js)   | ```try{} catch {}``` statement allows to *try* a block of code and setting in *catch* the block of code you want to execute if an exception is thrown |
