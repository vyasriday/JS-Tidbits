# JS Tidbits

### JS Tidbits is a collection of solutions of different programming problems as well as concepts in JavaScript.  

#### As part of Hacktoberfest I am inviting people to contribute to it.

#### How to Contribute

There are 3 different ways you can contibute:

  1. Know a Programming problem you want to solve in JavaScrpit, Go to **problems** folder inside **src** and add your solution file with a `.js` extension.
  2. You want to Provide example of any JavaScript concept, Go to **concepts** folder inside **src** and add your file with proper examlpe.
  3. See a bug, a code not working, or you think you can write a better code, fix it and raise a PR.
  
 NOTE: 
  - Please do not copy paste code from the internet and add in here!
  - Your code must be working


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Creating a PR for any issue
Please Check if Someone has already been assigned the task or not. After creating PR ask for assigning the task to yourself.

**Sorting** üßπ

| Problem               | Link          | Description     |   
| ----------------------|-------------- | --------------- |
| Bubble sort           | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/bubble_sort.js) | This algorithm consist in sorting an element in an array by swapping the item visited by the adjacent element if they are not in a correct order. You'll find a function for ascending and another for descending bubble sort in the link. |
| Comb sort             | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/comb_sort.js) | This algorithm, as Bubble Sort, swaps 2 elements in an array if they are not in the correct order, but it doesn't look for the adjacent one, Comb Sort uses a gap that starts with the length of the array and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 in every iteration. |
| Heap sort             | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/heap_sort.js)  | This algorithm compares the elements of an array using [Binary Heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-heap/), it sorts by setting an element as a node, if the element is greater than the others, it goes to the highest node and gets remove of the the sorting map. |
| Insertion sort        | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/insertion_sort.js)  | This algorithm divides the given array into a sorted (first element, to start) and unsorted part. In the 'unsorted part': it takes the first element and it's placed in the correct position of the sorted part to create the ascending sort. |
| Merge sort            | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/merge_sort.js)  | Breaks down the array dividing it by two until it gets the individual elements, then it sorts and merges, this algorithm applies recursion. |
| Quick sort            | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/quick_sort.js)  | This algorithm consists in taking an element as a pivot, then comparing to the pivot, it looks for a larger item (starting from the left) and a smaller item (starting from the right), it swaps the values until it sets the pivot in the correct position of the array, to be in the correct position means to have all the smaller on left and all the larger on the right. After this, it applies recyrsion by chooseing a new pivot in each "division" (right and left). |
| Radix sort            | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/radix_sort.js)  | This algorithm sorts the numbers from least significant digit (U) to the most significant digit (T, H). |
| Selection sort        | [link](https://github.com/vyasriday/JS-Tidbits/blob/master/src/problems/sorting/selection_sort.js)  | This algorithm takes the first element as the sorted one and finds the minimun element in the rest of the array comparing to the sorted one, if it's necessary they are swap, then moves to the next element and do the same process. |
